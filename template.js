const firstName = "sanjida"
const lastName = 'chowdhury'
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName);
const math = `the first name of me is ${firstName} and the last name ${lastName}`;
console.log(math);
//  \n is used to create new line in code
const newLine = 'hey, \n' + 'its you! long time no see'

// another easy way to do this is with backtick
const anotheLine = `hey! 
oh its you!
yes, its me!`
